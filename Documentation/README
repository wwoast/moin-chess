moin chess -- A Chess notation plugin for MoinMoin
Justin Cassidy, December 2014
--------------------------------------------------

== About ==
Moin Chess is a Wiki parser for MoinMoin that turns a PGN-formatted chess game
into a visual chessboard, with menus for navigation. It's designed to turn a
MoinMoin wiki into a knowledge management system for your chess games.


== Usage ==
To insert a chess board, including a full menu for navigating through a game, 
create a "Chess Game" tag, with a unique "Game ID".

{{{#!Chess Game Tournament-Round-1
PGN-or-FEN-moves
}}}


To insert a board without menus that references an existing game, create a
create a "Chess Board" tag. As long as the "Game ID" exists in the wiki as a
"Chess Game" tag, and that game tag has been viewed at least once, it can be
referenced by a "Chess Board" tag. 

{{{#!Chess Board Tournament-Round-1
8-White
}}}


== Current Limitations ==
To change the moves in a "Chess Game" tag, you currently need to change the
"Game ID" you use. This is protection against a "Game ID" getting redefined
elsewhere in the wiki. New versions of Moin Chess may remove this limitation.


== Administration ==
When a new "Chess Game" tag is parsed, it creates an entry in the MoinMoin
cache, stored under $MOIN/data/cache/wikiconfig/chess. As long as this cache
file exists, the contents of the Chess Game tag become "secondary" to the
cached version.

Server admins may delete these files, in case there are problems caused by
cached chess games in the Wiki.


== Upcoming Features ==
Better menu notation for the game's end-state (draw/win/mate)
Better board / move highlighting in the menus
Game tags with a predefined starting position
Fix caching behavior with respect to the first appearance of a Game tag
