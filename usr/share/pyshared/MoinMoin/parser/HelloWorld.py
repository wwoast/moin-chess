    NEEDS REVIEW - refactor into Parser page

Hello World parser for MoinMoin wiki.

This hopefully gives a basic idea of what a parser looks like and what
the parts of it mean. 

Parsers are kind of in flux. The whole moinmoin thing is being refactored
a lot. But for right now, 1.3, Parsers sort of work like this:

A parser gets created by a Page object, is given the text its supposed
to format and an HTTPRequest object. It mucks around with the text,
and writes the result to the HTTPRequest object it was given. 

To install:

Copy this file into data/plugins/parser in your moinmoin wiki instance.
Restart the wiki if necessary.
Edit a page and type in

{{{#!HelloWorld 1 2 3
rabbit
}}}

The result should be something like this inserted in your page: 

hello world begin
raw: rabbit
kw: 1 2 3
hello world end


You can get more ideas by looking in the
'python\Lib\site-packages\MoinMoin\parser' directory on your computer,
or by looking at http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/ParserMarket
at the parsers that others have written.
